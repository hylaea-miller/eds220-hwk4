## About

This repository contains all the materials for Homework Assignment 4 Task 2 and the Week 8 - Discussion section of the course EDS 220: Working with Environmental Datasets.

For this assignment, I explored the use of false color imagery to visualize fire scars from the Palisades and Eaton fires and examined their social dimensions. The analysis includes data processing, visualization, and interpretation of results.
